YADrone - Yet Another Drone Framework 
===============================================

YADrone is yet another open framework for controlling the AR.Drone 2. It features:

* Easy, yet powerful framework to control the drone
* Support for sensor readings and NavData, video and drone configuration
* A control center that visualizes sensor readings and allows to control the drone via keyboard
* Also supports Android (but no video)
* Framework is 100% pure Java and is easily extensible 

Of course, YADrone is still beta. There are some minor (known) bugs, but these mainly concern the control center and will be fixed someday soon. Nevertheless, you use this framework at your own risk. It is provided as is and YOU are responsible for any harm or drone damage. Please be careful !

YADrone is open: comments, bug reports and contributions are warmly welcome ! 

YADrone was initially based on the ARDroneForP5 project and added a NavData parser from the Javadrone project. Eventually, the code has been rebased on the lab-drone project a former extension of YADrone.
Credits and thanks go to all guys working on these projects, especially Shigeo Yoshida and Rian Wouters !
